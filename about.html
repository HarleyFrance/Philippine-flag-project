    <h1>Flag of Philippines</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The 1898 overthrow of Spanish authority by the United States led Filipinos
      to believe that their country’s independence, proclaimed on June 12, 1898,
      was guaranteed. A national flag quite different from the revolutionary
      banners used a few years before was adopted. At the hoist was a white
      triangle, symbolic of liberty and probably derived from Masonic symbolism.

      It bore a golden sun and three golden stars, standing for the three main
      areas in the Philippines—the Luzon group of islands in the north, the
      Visayan group in the south, and the main southern island of Mindanao. The
      eight sun rays were for the provinces where the original anti-Spanish
      revolt had broken out. The remainder of the flag consisted of horizontal
      stripes of blue (for the willingness to sacrifice oneself for freedom)
      over red (for courage).

      The first republic was finally suppressed by the United States, and its
      flag was outlawed between 1907 and 1920. In 1936 the new Commonwealth of
      the Philippines adopted that flag in anticipation of eventual
      independence. Under Japanese occupation, the Philippine flag was first
      forbidden and then officially recognized on October 14, 1943, when the
      Japanese-controlled second republic was proclaimed. Filipinos opposed to
      Japanese rule displayed the flag with the blue stripe down and the red
      stripe up (i.e., they hoisted the flag upside down). Finally, the United
      States granted independence to the Philippines on July 4, 1946, under the
      1898 flag. In 1985 President Ferdinand Marcos altered the shade of blue
      from dark to light in the belief that the earliest flags of the republic
      had featured light blue. His successor, Corazon Aquino, reversed the
      change, but on September 16, 1997, in anticipation of the centennial of
      the original Philippine flag, the top stripe was again changed, from dark
      navy blue to a lighter royal blue.
